Campus Event Management - Reporting System

 My Understanding of the Project

This project is a Campus Event Management prototype where college staff can create events and students can register, mark attendance, and give feedback. The main focus is on reporting â€” showing how many students registered, attended, and what their feedback was.

I built this project to show how a real-world event management system can work on a small scale using Flask (Python) and SQLite.
